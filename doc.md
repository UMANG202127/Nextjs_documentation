1. Introduction to Next.js ......

Next.js is an open-source web development framework based on React and has gained significant popularity due to its amazing features. It is developed by Vercel and Next.js stands out for its robust capabilities, including server-side rendering(SSR) and enhanced search engine optimization (SEO). Next.js provides built-in routing, making it simple to create dynamic routes and handle navigation within your application.

In this Next.js Tutorial, weâ€™ll learn all the basic to advanced concepts such as Routing, Data Fetching, Environment Variables, Meta Tags, Static File Serving, Pre-Rendering, etc.

Prerequisites to learn Next.js -
Before start learning NextJS you should have basic knowledge of how we shifted from JavaScript to React, after that, you can shift from React to NextJS. So you will need basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.

--Why learn Next.js?--
Next.js offers several advantages over traditional React development:

Built-in Routing and SSR: Unlike React, which lacks native routing, Next.js provides seamless routing functionality out of the box. Additionally, it supports server-side rendering, improving performance and SEO.
Faster Development: Next.js accelerates development by offering built-in features and conventions. Developers can focus on building features rather than configuring complex setups.
SEO Optimization: Next.js enhances SEO by addressing slow rendering and loading times associated with client-side rendering. Its SSR capabilities ensure that search engines can efficiently crawl and index your content.
Additionally, NextJS mitigates slow rendering and loading times inherent in client-side rendering, crucial for optimizing SEO performance. Its integration of server-side rendering out of the box enhances overall development efficiency and user experience.
These benefits make Next.js a compelling choice over ReactJS for many developers.

   --Main Features--
Some of the main Next.js features include:

Routing - A file-system based router built on top of Server Components that supports layouts, nested routing, 
          loading states, error handling, and more.
Rendering -	Client-side and Server-side Rendering with Client and Server Components. Further optimized with 
            Static and Dynamic Rendering on the server with Next.js. Streaming on Edge and Node.js runtimes.
Data Fetching -	Simplified data fetching with async/await in Server Components, and an extended fetch API for 
                request memoization, data caching and revalidation.
Styling	- Support for your preferred styling methods, including CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and CSS-in-JS
          Optimizations	Image, Fonts, and Script Optimizations to improve your application's Core Web Vitals 
          and User Experience.
TypeScript - Improved support for TypeScript, with better type checking and more efficient compilation, as 
             well as custom TypeScript Plugin and type checker.
